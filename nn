# INPUTS
#
# The neural network’s inputs will consist of one input for every possible
# character (from chars.dd, generated by char-counter), plus three more
# ‘control’ inputs, which we will call:
#   EOS  - end of sequence
#   EOC  - end of char
#   NOWT - representing nothingness
# and, in addition, a ‘conscience’ input.
#
# Every input will be a boolean (1/-1), with only one input on at a time
# (except for the last one, explained below).  To feed a particular page
# through the network, we will chop up each copy of the page into individ-
# ual characters, and then feed them through, in reverse (because research
# shows that works better), in parallel.  The EOC symbol means that we have
# gone through all the copies of the page, and are about to move on to the
# next character.  EOS indicates that there are no more characters left on
# any copy of the page.  NOWT is used when a particular copy has run out of
# characters, but the others are not exhausted yet.  The final ‘conscience’
# input is on if the current word is accented correctly according to the
# basic rules of Greek accentuation.  Instead of making the neural network
# figure this out on its own (it should be more effective if it does not
# have to learn *everything*), we can program the rules into the computer,
# and hope the network pays attention to the ‘voice of conscience’.
#
# For example, suppose we have a very tiny page, consisting of the follow-
# ing text (multiple copies):
#
# saaculo tertio adornata fuisse.
# saaculo tertio adornata fuisse.
# saculo tertio<NL>adamata fuisse.
# saeculo tertio adornata fuisse.
# saeculo tertio<NL>adornata fuisse.
# sate-alo tertio<NL>adornata fuisse.
#
# We will feed it through like this:
#    . . . . . . EOC
#    e e e e e e EOC
# ... etc. ...
#    f f f f f f EOC
#    SP SP SP SP SP SP EOC  (spaces)
#    a a a a a a EOC
#    t t t t t t EOC
#    a a a a a a EOC
#    n n m n n n EOC
#    r r a r r r EOC
#    o o d o o o EOC
#    d d a d d d EOC
#    a a NL a a a EOC
#    SP SP o SP NL NL EOC
#    o o i o o o EOC
# ... etc. ...
#    o o l o o o EOC
#    l l u l l l EOC
#    u u c u u a EOC
#    c c a c c - EOC
#    a a s e e e EOC
#    s s NOWT a a t EOC
#    NOWT NOWT NOWT s s a EOC
#    NOWT NOWT NOWT NOWT NOWT s EOS
#
# And then we will emit a sequence representing the column numbers for this
# page.  The format will be the reverse of ‘[147ABCD][148ABCD]’, followed
# by another EOS.
#
# For each of the input characters, the ‘conscience’ input will be on if
# the word is accented correctly in that copy.  For Latin words, as in this
# example, it stays off.
#
#
# OUTPUTS
#
# The outputs will also represent individual characters.  The list of char-
# acters will naturally be much smaller than the list of input characters.
# There will be an EOS token to mark the end of the page.  Whichever output
# has the highest number is the one that is counted.
